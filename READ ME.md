# Comprehensive-Banking-Analytics_Final-ML-Project
Models implemented to analyse the Banking dataset.

**Project Overview**
The Comprehensive Banking Analytics project aims to leverage advanced data analytics techniques to extract valuable insights and enhance decision-making processes within the banking sector. The project addresses key components including customer segmentation, credit risk assessment, and performance prediction using clustering, classification, and regression models.

1. # Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

Utilize clustering algorithms to group customers based on banking behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.
Explore and visualize customer segments to understand patterns and behaviors.

2. # Credit Risk Assessment (Classification)

Develop a credit scoring system using classification algorithms.
Train the model on historical data to predict the likelihood of default or late payments.
Integrate machine learning models into the credit approval process for enhanced risk management.

3. # Performance Prediction (Regression)

Build regression models to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) for the banking institution.
Analyze the impact of various factors on the bank's performance, such as economic indicators and market trends.
Provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation and investment strategies.
 
**Dataset**

Acquire and preprocess a comprehensive banking dataset, ensuring data quality and handling missing values.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.

**Technological Stack**

Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.
Visualization tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn for data exploration.

# Data visualization: 
Ploted colleration matrix to get insights about dependend and independed variables. Made chats like( Bocxplot,countplot,distplot,pairplot).

# Model Selection: 
K-Means+ clustering algorithm is used for creating segments and Made many classifiers models like Logistic Regression,RandomForestClassifier,DecisionTreeClassifier,LGBM classifier but selected LIGHT GBM Classifier.

**Model Accuracy: 98%**

**Deliverables**

# Visualizations and insights derived from the analysis.
A comprehensive report summarizing findings, model performances, and recommendations for the banking institution.

# Conclusion 
Creating a segmentation of customers based on their bank details and divide them into some groups through clustering algorithms and then making a prediction on those groups for new customers. Visualizations and insights derived from the analysis. A comprehensive report summarizing findings, model performances, and recommendations for the banking institution.
